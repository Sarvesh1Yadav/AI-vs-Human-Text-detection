# AI-Generated Text & Plagiarism Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect **AI-generated text** and identify potential **plagiarism** with high recall and accuracy.  
It compares traditional machine learning models with advanced deep learning approaches, including a fine-tuned transformer model.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Detect AI-generated text with **high precision** and **recall**.
- Identify potentially plagiarized content.
- Compare **Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, RNN, LSTM, and BERT**.
- Achieve **state-of-the-art results** with fine-tuned BERT + Word2Vec embeddings.
